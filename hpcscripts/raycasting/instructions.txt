This program assumes the following has been done:
	1. VirtualMaze has been set up according to "VirtualMaze for HPC" in "Hippocampus Code".
	2. VirtualMaze is located in ~/ on HPC
	3. HPC VirtualMaze folder renamed to VirtualMazeExe (to prevent confusion with source folder)
	4. Skeletal directories have been set up according to "Using OSort" in Hippocampus Code"

Save the list of sessions to be processed in this (Hippocampus/raycasting) folder as sessions.txt, separated by newline, see example:
	/volume1/Hippocampus/Data/picasso-misc/20181105/session01
	/volume1/Hippocampus/Data/picasso-misc/20181101/session01 

Check rcsubmit.pbs, ensure that the following parameters are ok:
	queue (eg. openmp, serial)
	number of cpus (suggested 5, depends on queue)
	memory (suggested 15GB, most queues can handle)

Files will be sequentially transferred in and passed as jobs with the command:
	sh rchpc.sh

Optional:
Update sessions in trackerlist.txt (for tracking purposes)
To get a live update of progress, run:
	watch -n 1 'qlist; sh jobtracker.sh'
